## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [School of Information](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. My faculty advisor is [Dr. Matt Lease](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~ml/). I am a part of the [Information Retrieval and Crowdsourcing Lab](http://ir.ischool.utexas.edu/). Before joining the Ph.D. program, I worked as a Software Engineer in [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/default.aspx) and as a Decision Scientist in [Mu Sigma](https://www.mu-sigma.com/). 

I received my Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Computer Science and Technology from [IIEST, Shibpur](http://www.iiests.ac.in/index.php).

## Research

My research interest is in Information Retrieval primarily focusing on Fairness and Transparency in Information Retrieval systems. I am also interested in Human-in-the-loop systems, Human-Computer Interaction, and Social Computing. 

## News

I will be working with [Dr. Gerhard Weikum](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~weikum/) at [The Max-Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) in summer 2019.
